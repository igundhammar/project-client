It's simple! Just run the command `git clone https://github.com/igundhammar/project-client.git`

## Questions? 游뱂
### How can I use this project?
Make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed on your PC.
Then clone this repository to your local PC and run the command `npm install` to install npm.
Then simply run the command `gulp` to create the public folder of the project and the related files.

There are several tasks in the project that will execute different tasks. Some of them concatenate, minimize and transfer files (SASS/CSS and JS)
and the others launch servers and browser reloads, as well as a watch function to discover which files to transfer.

If you want access to test the website with CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE, you can contact me and I will provide you with the user information to log in.

Start coding! 游뗵
